# Diabetes Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict diabetes risk using a healthcare dataset. By analyzing patient attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, and age, the study provides insights into diabetes management and prevention. The models used include Decision Trees and Random Forests.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Decision Trees and Random Forests for classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
- **Visualizations**: Includes ROC curves, cumulative gains charts, and decision tree diagrams.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the healthcare dataset used in the analysis.
- `code/`: Includes R scripts for data preprocessing and modeling.
- `report/`: Contains a detailed project report.
- `screenshots/`: Visual outputs from the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rockyied/Diabetes_Prediction.git
